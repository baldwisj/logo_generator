# logo_generator

This logo generator initiates a prompt to a user to create a logo so the need for a graphic designer is bypassed.

## Description
This logo generator was created using FS and inquirer packages and my knowledge of node.js. The purpose of the generator is to ask the user for imput to create a logo SVG file.

## Usage
The generator works by first entering node index.js into the terminal. Then, the user will be prompted with four questions- text, text color, logo shape, and logo color. These choices will then be utilized in the program to build a SVG and a new logo file. The file also uses JEST to test the application for errors. To run the test, enter npx jest in the terminal.

## Conclusion
During the creation of this logo generator I had to read-up on and lean about SVG structure, as well as showcase my skills in node.js. This involved:

- Being able to install and require packages like Jest, Inquirer, and JS.

- The ability to export and inport functionality/classes from one file to the other

- Showcasing ability to create classes and constructoring classes

- Refining skills pertaining to writing a new file from a code commant (i.e. writeFile/readFile...ext)

- Demonstraiting skills in inquirer and writing effective prompts.
